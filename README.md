# Pac-MAS
An adaptive multi-agent version of Pac-Man, developed in HTML5 using the [Phaser.io game engine](https://phaser.io/). Created for the Self-Adaptive Systems course (CS-7863-01) at the University of Tulsa.

Assets are either taken from the original 1980 Pac-Man (via [Spriter's Resource](https://www.spriters-resource.com/arcade/pacman/)) or created by me.
